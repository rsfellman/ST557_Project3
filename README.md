# ST557_Project3
ST558 project 3 repository 

# Description
This repository is where Sabrina Dahl and Rachel Fellman will be working together on project 3 for ST 558. We will analyze data using different models and create 5 output files that will be linked below.

# R Packages
`tidyverse`
`caret`

# Code to Render Files

Need to fix this when we automate the creation of the different files. This is just a start.

``` {r}
rmarkdown::render("C:/Users/rfell/Documents/Grad Certificate/ST 558/ST558Project2/project3.rmd", 
                  output_format = "github_document", 
                  output_file = " ",
                  output_options = list(
                    toc = TRUE,
                    number_sections = TRUE,
                    toc_depth = 2,
                    df_print = 'tibble'
                  )
```
