# Introduction

# Data

We will start by reading in the data with the `read_csv` function with a relative path. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
diabetes <- read_csv("diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv")
```

Next we will combine the 1 and 2 groups in the `Education` variable into a new group. We will do this using the `mutate` and `ifelse` functions. The new value for the 1 and 2 groups will just be 1, so `Education` can equal 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

```{r}
diabetes.1 <- diabetes %>% 
  mutate(Education = ifelse(Education < 3, 1, Education))
```
